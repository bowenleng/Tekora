# Tekora
![](https://github.com/bowenleng/Tekora/blob/main/logo.png)Technologic Ores And More!

Tekora is a tech based mod for Minecraft and a base mod for future projects.
<br>
Tekora plans to implement a whole host of machines into Minecraft using most naturally occurring elements of the periodic table

NOTE: I have decided that once I update Tekora to 1.21.x version of Minecraft, the mod will stay in that version until I can create a working and viable alpha or beta release.

-----
**Requests**

I mainly take bug fix requests and they will generally be my top priority
however, I will still take some requests to add or remove specific features
<br>
Tekora has a doc of planned features that should all be realized by version 4
and as such is not flexible to new ideas.

-----
**Addons**

Tekora will likely have a couple of dependencies to it since some of the code
in Tekora is rudimentary for features I plan for other mods I may make in the
future.

-----
**Permissions**

I permit anyone to go through this repository and copy minor snippets of the
sourcecode, meaning everyone can copy my code as they please, as long as the
final product of their use of my code is their own original work. However, if
you copy anything bigger than a single method, you have to credit me as the
original author behind the method, unless I credited someone else for said
method. However, I do NOT permit anyone to make a copy/replica of my mod unless
it is for versions of Minecraft this mod currently has no support on.
