# Tekora
![](https://github.com/bowenleng/Tekora/blob/main/logo.png)Technologic Ores And More!

Tekora is a tech based mod for Minecraft and a base mod for future projects.
<br>
Tekora plans to implement a whole host of machines into Minecraft using most naturally occurring elements of the periodic table

NOTE: I have decided that once I update Tekora to 1.21.x version of Minecraft, the mod will stay in that version until I can create a working and viable alpha or beta release.

-----
**Requests**

I mainly take bug fix requests and they will generally be my top priority
however, I will still take some requests to add or remove specific features
<br>
Tekora has a doc of planned features that should all be realized by version 4
and as such is not flexible to new ideas.

-----
**Addons**

Tekora will likely have a couple of dependencies to it since some of the code
in Tekora is rudimentary for features I plan for other mods I may make in the
future.
